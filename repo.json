The updated wizard can create more working configurations such as RISC-V64 Ubuntu, classic Mac OS 8.x/9.x, and Windows 95/98.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.4)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash on VM start when a toolbar menu was reinitialized (note v4.7.4 was re-released to address this) (#7408)\r\n* Home: Fixed layout issue with button titles\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a crash when VM exits while USB is active\r\n* (iOS) Support for StikDebug on iOS 26 (non-SE only)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM results in a block device error\r\n* Stop button can now be used a second time to force kill a VM if it is unresponsive after stopping for the first time\r\n* libusb: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes when using USB capture\r\n* CocoaSpice: Fixed multiple race conditions that caused crashes during VM start\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (macOS) Scripting: Fixed broken commands due to name collision (#7360)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed crash when exiting full screen (#7377)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.7.2)\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Fixed a crash when starting any Apple Virtualization VM (#7355) (We are re-releasing v4.7.2 with build 112 due to this critical bug.)\r\n* Home: Display network details and active IP addresses on the home details screen (thanks @gabefair)\r\n* Home: Show a security warning message when importing a .utm with custom arguments (#6252)\r\n* Config: Option to reset UEFI without pre-loading Secure Boot keys (useful for custom TPM configurations) (#7005)\r\n* Config: Pre-loading Secure Boot keys will now install Microsoft UEFI 2023 certificates (#7257)\r\n* Config: When PS/2 device is enabled, no longer create USB mouse and keyboard devices. This allows older Windows install to work out of the box.\r\n* Config: Quotes in custom arguments are no longer stripped (unless the only quotes wrap the entire argument) (#6343)\r\n* Config: Provide a fixed serial number for VirtIO block devices (#7332)\r\n* QEMU: Fixed an issue which causes Windows 98 to BSoD (#7342)\r\n* QEMU: Do not create a default floppy drive when -nodefaults is used. UTM configuration will set up a FDC device and this is the only way to set up bootindex for floppy.\r\n* Wizard: Legacy Windows configurations will now use PS/2 controller by default\r\n* Wizard: Update OS logos to be consistent with other icons\r\n* Wizard: Windows + i440fx hardware will now instantiate default devices (sound, VGA, networking) that should work with Windows 95/98\r\n* Wizard: Add additional supported hardware configurations for running older Windows\r\n* Wizard: Support floppy boot for Windows configuration\r\n* Scripting: New input automation suite for sending keyboard and mouse input (#6462)\r\n* USB: Fixed a rare crash when initializing the USB devices list (#5811)\r\n* SPICE: Fixed an issue where monitor configuration sent to spice-vdagent contains an invalid size (#5832)\r\n* Localization: Updated Chinese (Hong Kong, Simplified) (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Toolbar: Fix foreground issue on iOS 26 beta 5 and higher\r\n* (macOS) Added ability to auto-connect USB devices on start (#3400)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed connecting USB devices from secondary windows\r\n* (macOS) New \"Virtual Machine\" menu which mirrors the actions accessible through the toolbar\r\n* (macOS) Keyboard Shortcuts toolbar icon is no longer shown by default (it can be placed on the toolbar through View -> Customize Toolbar).

This allows Ubuntu for RISC-V64 to work out of the box. (#7183)\r\n* QEMU PPC: Disable `bootindex` when `boot-device` is used in prom-env. This allows Yellow Dog Linux for PPC to work out of the box. (#6436)\r\n* QEMU x86_64: Fixed floppy boot order configuration for other PC models (isapc, i440fx) (#7166)\r\n* QEMU PPC/M68K: Includes classicvirtio drivers to support cursor input without capture and directory sharing (#6520)\r\n* QEMU M68K: Fixed virtio drive config (#7008)\r\n* Fixed a rare crash after stopping VM due to a race condition in libusb\r\n* Home: improve screenshot contrast in Dark Mode (#6894)\r\n* Config: Fixed a crash when trying to enter a large size value when creating a new drive (#7295)\r\n* Config: Corrected the default host IP address in port forwarding config to \"0.0.0.0\" when it incorrectly displayed \"127.0.0.1\" (#7132)\r\n* Keyboard Shortcuts: Create custom combinations of keyboard shortcuts from either Settings -> Input or via the Keyboard icon in the VM (press and hold on iOS/visionOS). This will allow you to easily send key commands such as Ctrl+Alt+Del or Stop+A to the VM. (#5698, #6310, #6757)\r\n* Wizard: New option to import an existing drive image when setting up a Linux VM.

      "localizedDescription": "Ready is an open source emulator for the following 8 bit home computers:\n* Commodore 64\n* Commodore VIC-20\n* Commodore 16, Plus/4\n* Sinclair ZX Spectrum (16k, 48k, Spectrum+, 128k, +2)\n\nWith preliminary support for these computers:\n* Atari 600XL, 800XL\n* Commodore 128\n* Commander X16\n\nIt is based on atari800, fuse, Vice, and x16-emulator, which provide accurate emulation of many hardware variants and peripherals. Ready requires at least iPadOS 13.5.\n\nReady aims to approximate the feeling of using actual hardware. Rather than configuring abstract settings, you select hardware components. The software keyboard is a facsimile of the original, reflecting the different existing styles. Even the noise of the disk drive is emulated. The Library section offers a way to organize a large collection of games, demos and programs. The emulated hardware can be customized for each entry.\n\nThe Inbox provides a place to quickly try new programs. You can easily move the ones you want to keep to the library.\n\nTools mode allows attaching a cartridge like Action Replay or Final Cartridge and a collection of disks with your favorite tools, to help you dig into the programs, like back in the day.",

      "localizedDescription": "PPSSPP is the best and only PSP emulator for iOS written in C++. It is capable of running a lot of original games but, depending on the power of your device, not all may run at full speed due to restrictions on non-jailbroken devices.\n\nThe app was originally created by Henrik Rydg\u00e5rd in November 2012; however, iOS builds are mostly managed by talented developer, Karen Tsai (aka @angelxwind) and a large group of contributors that submit issue reports and fixes. Several versions of PPSSPP can be played on numerous devices such as Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and Blackberry 10. The iOS version can be found on both Jailbreak and non-Jailbreak devices.\n\nPPSSPP supports all versions of iPad, iPhone, iPod touch running iOS 5 and above; this includes iPhone 5 and other retina-enabled devices. The emulator does not require bios to play, PPSSPP is - in many ways - a \u201cHLE\u201d emulator. PPSSPP requires ROM images, specifically .ISO or .CSO files, to play. No ROMs are included in this copy of the emulator. If you own any games, add them through iTunes Sharing or other programs like 'iExplorer.' Keep in mind these files are extremely big, sometimes taking several gigs in size.\n\nThe emulator is built to use JIT decompilers (dynarecs) which can only be accessed on a jailbroken device due to the codesigining requirement. Therefore, most games will run very slow on non-jailbroken devices; however, there are a few older PSP games that will run just fine and up to speed depending on your iOS device.",

However, with the current dumping programs you will not get a complete bootrom and booting the OS will fail.\r\n\r\n**Improvements:**\r\n* Multiple files can be sent in the Mobile UI and by dropping them into the main window on desktop (#279)\r\n Reimplemented emulation speed control: Now it's more accurate, especially on Windows\r\n* GitHub actions now performs automated builds for Android (armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a in one APK), macOS and Windows (32bit and 64bit) on releases and pull requests (#283, #284, #285)\r\n* The \"installer\" for OS 4.5.3.14 (and later?) works now. It requires [fastboot RAM](https://hackspire.org/index.php?title=Memory-mapped_I/O_ports_on_CX#90030000_-_Fastboot_RAM) to persist state across reboots, which is now implemented.\r\n* More accurate emulation of the On button: It's now possible to enter Press-To-Test mode (#271)\r\n* Faster saving and loading of snapshots (#231)\r\n* More reliable USB file transfers\r\n* The debugger console now includes entered commands in the log\r\n* Support for PIE (position-independent executables) on x86_64. Previously, care needed to be taken that PIE was disabled, otherwise it would crash on start. (#211)\r\n* Building the JIT is disabled automatically if the platform does not support it (#197)\r\n* Firebird builds on FreeBSD now (#228, #248)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n* File access on Android got fixed (#202 and its various duplicates)\r\n* Fix placement of keypad buttons in the touchpad area (#41)\r\n* Various fixes for the Mobile UI layout (#201)\r\n* The kit configuration page in the Mobile UI no longer causes the keyboard to pop up by default (#257)\r\n* Connecting with GDB on windows works now (#259, #260)\r\n* Some shades of grey were not displayed properly when emulating pre-CX models (#270)\r\n* Fix crash on AArch64/arm64 when executing certain instructions\r\n* The keypad reacts to touch events in the desktop version as well now (#292, #293)\r\n* Some places were no longer translated correctly after the introduction of language switching in 1.5\r\n* Keys could get stuck on focus changes. Now they're all released when the keypad loses focus (#287)\r\n* The Ctrl key now changes color when pressed\r\n* Emulation speed no longer remains unlimited after a failed file transfer\r\n\r\n_Repo for Arch, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE: [via OBS](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3AVogtinator%3Afirebird-emu&package=firebird-emu&locale=en)._\r\n\r\nThere is work in progress to implement and improve support for running in the browser on Qt for WebAssembly (#294).

I have no other choice except to modify the bundle ID of CercubePlus (Legacy). Thus, you won't be able to install CercubePlus (Legacy) directly through AltStore. You still can download the IPA like normal though.\n\nFull infomation about CercubePlus (Legacy) is available on my Github: https://github.com/qnblackcat/CercubePlus/tree/iOS-12/\n\nCredits: Please keep the Credits if you re-up CercubePlus (Legacy)! \n- Alfhaily for Cercube.\n- Galactic-Dev for the original iSponsorBlockLegacy, @Luewii for his fork of iSponsorBlock (which works in jailed mode).\n- PoomSmart for YouRememberCaption, YTClassicVideoQuality, YTNoCheckLocalNetwork, YTSystemAppearance, and Return YouTube Dislike.\n- level3tjg for YTNoHoverCards.\n\nKnown issues:\n- YTUHD is removed because most iOS 12 devices don't support VP9 codec (Hardware restriction).\n- iOS 12 doesn't have the built-in Picture in Picture mode like iOS 14+, so YouPiP must be removed as well.\n- Hide Cast button may not work.\n- YouPiP (iOS 14.0 - 14.4.2): due to Apple's fault, you may encounter the speedup-bug as described here. The bug also happens when you try to play multi-sources of sound at the same time. Enable Legacy PiP is a workaround. Note that Legacy PiP removes UHD quality and breaks the default video quality feature of uYou. Use it at your own risk!",

The ethos of the app is to merge the technologies of today with a pixel-perfect recreation of the user experience of the past. The vast majority of apps in OldOS are fully functional \u2014 meaning they seamlessly integrate with the data on your phone to deliver a live, emulator-esque experience. What does this mean? Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don't worry, they're coming soon.\n\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia \u2014 it's available on your daily driver.\n\nPart of the goal with OldOS is to enable anyone to understand how iOS works and demonstrate just how powerful SwiftUI truly is. For that reason, the entire app is open-sourced \u2014 enabling developers to learn about, modify, and add to the app. I thought building this over my last six or so months in high school and sharing it with the world would be a fun and productive endeavor.\n\nSpecial Features:\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Built almost entirely using SwiftUI.\n* \ud83c\udfa8 Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.\n* \ud83d\udcf1 Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.\n* \u2764\ufe0f A testament to the work of Apple employees of both the past and the present.\n* \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on.",

The DPAD works in 8-axis way. It can also be toggled into a joystick.\n\nExternal bluetooth game controllers are supported. Make sure your game controller is connected (System Settings->Bluetooth). To customize button bindings, go to iDOS in landscape mode, tap on bluetooth icon on the auto-hiding top bar.\n\nMOUSE\n\n* The screen area serves as a trackpad for moving mouse pointer.\n* Tap on the screen for left click.

GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n\u2022 Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n\u2022 Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n\u2022 Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n\u2022 Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n\u2022 Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n\u2022 MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!",
